**Gentoo on Khadas** Portage overlay

## Introduction

This [Portage](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage) overlay contains ebuilds
with patches specific for Khadas boards. Currently, only VIM3 is supported;
others may work, but there’s no guarantee since they’re not tested.

Most of these ebuilds are based off [Khadas Fenix](https://github.com/khadas/fenix),
which is the official project for building packages for Khadas boards.
